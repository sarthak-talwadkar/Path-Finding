A simple pathfinding visualizer built using Pygame that lets you interactively place a start point, end point, and walls, then visualize algorithms like Dijkstra and A* in action on a grid.
Use mouse clicks to draw on the grid and press a key to watch the algorithm explore and find the shortest path.
